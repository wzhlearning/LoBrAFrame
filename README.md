## A Unified fNIRS Classification Framework Informed by Local Brain Activation Patterns

Our paper titled *A Unified fNIRS Classification Framework Informed by Local Brain Activation Patterns* has been accepted by IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics ([https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9670659](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11279989)). 

Our code, including dataset processing, models, training, and evaluation, will be released to this repository.

### Abstract
Recent studies have focused on task-specific and neuroscience-agnostic fNIRS classification models rather than a unified neuroscience-informed framework. We propose ***LoBrAFrame***, a unified, neuroscience-informed fNIRS classification framework that leverages local brain activation patterns through a shared weight mechanism. Within this framework, researchers can easily enhance classification performance using simple or off-the-shelf methods, without redesigning complex models. To instantiate a concrete model, we introduce Mamba, a state space model, into the fNIRS domain and propose ***LoBrAMamba***. Our work will inspire interest in neuroscience-informed fNIRS frameworks.
